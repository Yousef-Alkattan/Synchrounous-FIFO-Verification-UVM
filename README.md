# Synchrounous-FIFO-Verification-UVM

This repository contains the complete UVM testbench and design files for verifying a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) module. Below is a breakdown of each file and its role in the testbench architecture.

## üî∑ Introduction

This project presents a **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)**-based testbench for verifying a **synchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** buffer.  
FIFO is a critical component in digital systems, acting as a temporary storage queue that manages data transfer between modules operating on different clock domains or execution rates.

Our design features multiple control and status signals such as `full`, `almostfull`, `empty`, `almostempty`, `overflow`, and `underflow`, ensuring safe and efficient data communication.

The verification framework rigorously tests these features using structured UVM components like sequences, agents, drivers, monitors, and scoreboards to provide **comprehensive functional coverage**.

## Conclusion

The UVM-based verification environment for the FIFO buffer has proven successful in ensuring **design correctness, protocol compliance, and data integrity** across a wide range of functional scenarios.  
This includes edge cases like simultaneous read/write operations, resets during transactions, and overflow/underflow events.

Through the use of **SystemVerilog Assertions**, **Golden reference models**, and **UVM sequences**, we‚Äôve implemented a reusable and scalable testbench that achieves high confidence in the FIFO's reliability for integration into larger digital systems.

This project reflects best practices in functional verification and demonstrates the value of **automated, structured verification methodologies** like UVM in modern digital design flows.
